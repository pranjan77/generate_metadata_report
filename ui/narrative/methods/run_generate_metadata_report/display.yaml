    This app can be used to compare all objects of given type in a narrative. Input is the object type of interest. App reads the metadata fields of each object of that type and generates a report.
    <br>
    eg. When a user selects KBaseRNASeq.Alignment as input, output is a table that compares all object of that type in the narrative in fields like total_reads, size, alignment rate, mapped reads etc.
    </br>
    It only works if objects of selected type are present in the narrative. It doesn't show error but output is just an empty table.
    </br>

    Following 5 object types are supported and can be selected from the drop down menu. 
    1. KBaseRNASeq.RNASeqAlignment
    2. KBaseGenomeAnnotations.Assembly
    3. KBaseFile.SingleEndLibrary
    4. KBaseFile.PairedEndLibrary
    5. KBaseGenomes.Genome
